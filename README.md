# map-app-demo

Just a quick demo of how to run this app:

1. Run npm install (I have express saved globally on my pc so you may have to install express locally before running server.js using command 'npm i -g express')

backend server file is ./server.js. Just run that with 'node server.js'

The frontend is just a simple create-react-app template, go to the map-app directory and then run 'npm start'

Then just go to localhost:3000 in your browser and you're good to go!
